### USAGE

The use of the Visual Feedback add-on is demonstrated in the following video (alongside other similar add-ons):

[![YouTube: Anki add-on guide: Gamify Your Reviews](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkveLkAgXiM/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UkveLkAgXiM)

Please note that some parts of the video (especially in regards to add-on configuration) are outdated since they were recorded on Anki 2.0.

### CONFIGURATION

You can configure the add-on by heading to Tools → Add-ons, selecting the add-on in the list, and then clicking on configure.

The settings you can adjust include:

- the *duration* time of the feedback image
- the *image set* to use

Additional image sets may be installed by placing a `lapsed.png` and `passed.png` file under `./user_files/images/_set-name_` where `_set_name_` is a name of your choice. Sets added in this way can then be chosen by setting them in the add-on configuration dialog.

E.g., if I wanted to add a new set called "basic", I would head to Tools → Add-ons, click on "Visual Feedback", click on "Open Add-ons folder", then create the `user_files` directory if it doesn't exist, create an `images` folder within that, and then place my `lapsed.png` and `passed.png` files in there. Then I would open the add-on's config window under Tools → Add-ons → Configure, and set `imageSet` to `basic`.
